# House Price Prediction Model

A house price prediction model using regression techniques with a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions.

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model. It includes data preprocessing techniques like handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables to ensure accurate predictions. The model is further refined using K-fold cross-validation for enhanced robustness. The model is deployed with a Flask server and features a responsive web interface for easy user interaction.

## Features
- **Linear Regression Model**: Predicts house prices based on various input features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, applies feature scaling, and encodes categorical variables.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Enhances the robustness of the model by validating performance across multiple data splits.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to input data and receive real-time predictions.

## Technology Used
- **Python**: For building the regression model and server-side logic.
- **Numpy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the linear regression model and K-fold cross-validation.
- **Flask**: For deploying the model as a web service.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building a responsive web interface.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization during analysis.
